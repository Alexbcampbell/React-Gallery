# React Photo Gallery

React - Gallery of My Life

## Description

With this project, my goal was to create a gallery that displays my photos along with a description when the phot is clicked. Below the photo is a Like button and a display of how many times the photo was liked.

Using axios to establish a GET and PUT route to my client side application, I was able to retrieve photo data from my server and display it to my page. From there, I created components that took care of the photo description toggle and like features.

## Usage

1. Click on a picture.
2. Picture will turn into a description.
3. If you like the picture, click the like button!
4. The like counter will update with how many times it is liked.

### Built With

HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Postman, Axios, Bootstrap and React.
